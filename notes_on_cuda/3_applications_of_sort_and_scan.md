####**"Compact"**  
Say we have a bunch of numbers to run some process on, but we only want to process on even numbers, so we pick the even numbers out first. This is called compacting (or filtering).  
**Input**: x1, x2, x3, x4, x5  
**Predicate**: F, T, F, F, T (e.g. even or not?)  
**Sparse output**: -, x2, -, -, x5  
**Dense output**: x2, x5  
Generally dense output is preferred.  
Compact is most useful when we compact away a large number of elements, and the computation on each surviving element is expensive.

####**Core Algorithms of Compacting**  
Let's assume the predicate results are: T, F, F, T, T, F, T, F  
Our task is to produce the dense output; to do this, we have to pick out all the true items and put them in the same array, which means we need to generate the **scatter addresses** of all true elements.  
The scatter addresses will then look like this: 0, -, -, 1, 2, -, 3, -  
If we convert T & F into 1 & 0, predicate would look like this: 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0  
And it turns out that compacting be done with exclusive scan on this array: 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4  
(We don't care about the results of items with false predicates)  

If we're to compact 1 to 1,000,000 with the follow 2 separate predicates:  
A. Divisible by 17 (This will remove a bunch of numbers)  
B. Not divisible by 31 (This one won't)  
Time for predicating: A = B  
Time for scanning: A = B  
**Time for scattering: A < B**  

In a more generalized form of compacting, the predicate results might be numbers rather than simple T/F. In that case, we can also use scan to produce the scatter addresses.  

####**Segmented Scan**  
Sometimes, we want to perform multiple small scans instead of one large scan. Since using one kernel for each small scan is too wasteful, what we could do instead is comcatenating all small segments into one large array, and perform a special scan call "segmented scan" on it. For example:  
**Input**: 1 2 | 3 4 5 | 6 7 8  
**Output (exclusive)**: 0 1 | 0 3 7 | 0 6 13  
Why is this useful and how is this done? The following will provide 2 examples.  

####**Sparse Matrix** 
This is how we represent a sparse matrix A (mostly with lots of zeros):    
A = [ a 0 b; c d e; 0 0 f]  
**Value**: [a b c d e f] <-(list out all non-zero values)  
**Column**: [0 2 0 1 2 1] <-(column index of all non-zero values)  
**RowPtr**: [0 2 5] <-(rows start at a, c, f, and their indices in **Value** are stored here)  

####**Spare Matrix/Dense Vector Multiplication (SpMv)**  
With sparse matrices, we can perform matrix multiplication more efficiently.  
Say we want to multiply A * B, where B is [x;y;z].  
1. Create segmented representation from **Value** and **RowPtr**.  
A_sparse = [a b | c d e | f]  
2. Gather vector values using **Column**. For example, b is to be multiplied with z, which can be found out using **Column**.  
B_gathered = [x z | x y z | y]  
3. Compute pairwise multiplication (with map).  
mul = [ax bz | cx dy ez | fy]  
4. Finally, perform segmented scan on it!  

####**Sorting**  
Sorting algorithms are tricky for parallelism, since most of them are serial algorithms.  
Here we're gonna make merge sort parallel.  
The merge part can be parallelized; say we want to merge these 2 lists:  
**List 1**: 1, 3, 12, 28  
**List 2**: 2, 10, 15, 21
Since merging them into one list is simply finding out their index in the merged list, this is the results we're looking for:  
**List 1**: 1, 3, 12, 28 -> [0, 2, 4, 7]  
**List 2**: 2, 10, 15, 21 -> [1, 3, 5, 6]  
But how do we find out the index of an element, say, x? It turns out we simply have to find **index_own**(index of x in its own list), and **index_other**(index of where should be in the other list), and sum them up.  
For example, index_own of 15 is 2, and index_other should be 3. 2+3=5, which is the index of 15 in the merged list!  
index_own is self-explanatory; as for index_other, we can use **binary search** to find it in the other list.  
This way, every element is assigned a thread, and every thread performs binary search on the other list, computing the final index.
